            <h1>Nature</h1>
            <p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.
                If nature could talk, it would probably say it doesn’t much matter ​either way. We must understand there are aspects of how our planet evolves that are totally out of our control. But there are things that we can manage, control and do responsibly that will allow us and the planet to evolve together.

                1. Walks in nature help your memory  
In general, exercise is great, but one study from the University of Michigan showed participants who took a memory test and then walked in nature did 20% better than those who took the test and then took a walk around the city.1 Mother Earth knows what she’s doing.  

 You feel happier  
According to one Finnish study, spending just 15 minutes sitting in nature helped people feel psychologically restored. Those results were even faster when they spent that time walking.2  

Nature can literally heal  
One study shows that people exposed to more natural light healed faster from a spinal surgery and reportedly had less pain than others.3 It seems nature served as a natural drug for them, because they also took fewer pain medications.

                    We are in this age where we need to understand the importance of nature. We have been focused on short term and selfish goals that are only limited to ourselves and mostly just extended to our relatives or friends.
                    
                    The emphasis on the American Dream or the definition of the perfect lifestyle is so much that we forget to pay attention to the things we get for free. Just because we get them for free, we tend to take those things for granted.</span>
